            <h2>About Me</h2>
            Hello! This is Sven Wels, a video game programmer studying at the HKU currently in my second year.
            I was born in 2001 and have lived in Amsterdam-Zuidoost ever since. 

            <br />
            A short and disastrous foray into mechanical engineering led me to try something I really wanted to do. I applied to the HKU, and got accepted into the Game Development program in 2022. I've felt more at home in this field than anywhere else, and the more I grow as a developer the more I enjoy making games. 
                        
            <br><br> <h2>Interests</h2>
            What I like to spend my time doing the most is making things. That usually comes down to making video games or other digital artifacts, but I've ended up making a lot of electronic items over the past while and enjoyed that as well.
            <br /><br />

            Broadly speaking, I love just about anything that really commit to its own personality- and the bolder the better. Striking visuals, unique music, stylish mechanics, they're easy ways to my heart.
            <br /><br />
            Inspiration-wise, some of the works that have had the most impact on me are <i>Kill Six Billion Demons, Chainsaw Man, Outer Wilds, ULTRAKILL, and Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!</i>

            <br><br> <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
            I'm currently enjoying experimenting with Godot, an open-source game engine similar to Unity. Getting more broad experience across game engines is a good step in and of itself, but potentially being able to switch to an open-source engine for smaller full projects could be very valuable.
            <br />

            <!--<br><br> <h2>Journey</h2>
            My journey into the world of coding began after I learned 3D modeling in Blender. It sparked the idea of integrating my models into games, 
            leading me to discover game jams. Through these events, I faced various challenges in game development, but my passion for music, coding, 
            and art ultimately guided me towards pursuing game development as my college major.-->
