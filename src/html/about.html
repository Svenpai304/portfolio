            <h2>introduction</h2>
            Greetings! My name is Philip. I am a Dutch <span>&#x1F1F3;&#x1F1F1;</span> second-year college student following the game development program at the HKU (Utrecht University of the Arts). 
            I'm incredibly passionate about making games, creating music, drawing art and exploring new skills and knowledge.
            
            <br><br> <h2>Interests</h2>
            I draw inspiration from the stylish aesthetics of the 30s, envisioning big band scenes where everyone wears hats. 
            I'm particularly fascinated by games like <a href="https://cuphead.wiki.gg/wiki/Cuphead_Wiki">Cuphead</a> and manga like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family">Spy x Family</a>
            for their captivating art styles reminiscent of the 30-50s era.
            Outside my game development studies is music which I make in Fl Studio<iconify-icon icon="arcticons:fl-studio-mobile"></iconify-icon>, my other big passion. I spend a lot of time composing and experimenting with different sounds.
            When it comes to art and design, I strive to create pieces that evoke joy, using vibrant colors and incorporating subtle humor. In terms of coding, 
            I'm always seeking to enhance the modularity and efficiency of my code, often exploring design patterns to optimize my projects.

            <br><br> <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
            <iconify-icon icon="devicon-plain:godot" width="24" height="24" class="textIcons"></iconify-icon> 
            I  am eager to learn more about Godot, an open-source game engine. Its open-source nature fascinates me because I appreciate the community-driven aspect and the cost-free access, which is especially important for me as a student.
            <br>
            <iconify-icon icon="ic:baseline-code" width="24" height="24" class="textIcons"></iconify-icon>  
            I want to enhance my ability to structure code better and make it more efficient. I believe this is crucial for becoming a better developer, as well-organized and efficient code makes development easier for both myself and others.
            <br>
            <iconify-icon icon="gridicons:audio" width="24" height="24" class="textIcons"></iconify-icon> 
            I am very interested in audio and music, and I want to become better at composing music that sounds professional. I also want to learn more about FMOD, a powerful tool for integrating audio in Unity.

            <!--<br><br> <h2>Journey</h2>
            My journey into the world of coding began after I learned 3D modeling in Blender. It sparked the idea of integrating my models into games, 
            leading me to discover game jams. Through these events, I faced various challenges in game development, but my passion for music, coding, 
            and art ultimately guided me towards pursuing game development as my college major.-->
